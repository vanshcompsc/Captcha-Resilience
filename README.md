# Captcha-Resilience
Evaluating how resistant a CAPTCHA system is against automated attacks or bypass techniques. This involves assessing various methods used to defeat CAPTCHA.

1.  CAPTCHA Types:
Identify the different types of CAPTCHA commonly used:

Text-based: Users are required to identify and enter text from distorted images.
Image-based: Users must select certain images (e.g., "select all images with traffic lights").
Audio-based: Users listen to audio clips and enter the text they hear.
Interactive: Users perform simple interactions (e.g., sliding a puzzle piece into place).

2.  Test Objectives:
Assessing how well a CAPTCHA resists automated scripts or bots.
Identifying vulnerabilities in the CAPTCHA implementation.

3.  Tools Used (Till date):
OpenCV: A powerful library for computer vision tasks.
scikit-image: A Python library for image processing and analysis.
Pytesseract: Extract text from CAPTCHA images.
Selenium: Automate browser interactions.

The continued development of Buster is made possible thanks to the support of awesome backers. If you'd like to join them, please consider contributing with Patreon, PayPal or Bitcoin.

Description

Buster is a browser extension which helps you to solve difficult CAPTCHAs by completing reCAPTCHA audio challenges using speech recognition. Challenges are solved by clicking on the extension button at the bottom of the reCAPTCHA widget.

Obviously, this blue part here is the land.

Motivation

reCAPTCHA challenges remain a considerable burden on the web, delaying and often blocking our access to services and information depending on our physical and cognitive abilities, our social and cultural background, and the devices or networks we connect from.

The difficulty of CAPTCHA challenges can be so out of balance, that sometimes they seem friendlier to bots than they are to humans.

The goal of this project is to improve our user experience on the web, by giving us easy access to solutions utilized by automated systems.

Client App

The client app enables you to simulate user interactions and improves the success rate of the extension. Follow the instructions from the extension's options to download and install the client app on Windows, Linux and macOS, or get the app from this repository.
