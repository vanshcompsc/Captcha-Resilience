# Captcha-Resilience
Evaluating how resistant a CAPTCHA system is against automated attacks or bypass techniques. This involves assessing various methods used to defeat CAPTCHA.

1.  CAPTCHA Types:
Identify the different types of CAPTCHA commonly used:

Text-based: Users are required to identify and enter text from distorted images.
Image-based: Users must select certain images (e.g., "select all images with traffic lights").
Audio-based: Users listen to audio clips and enter the text they hear.
Interactive: Users perform simple interactions (e.g., sliding a puzzle piece into place).

2.  Test Objectives:
Assessing how well a CAPTCHA resists automated scripts or bots.
Identifying vulnerabilities in the CAPTCHA implementation.

3.  Tools Used (Till date):
OpenCV: A powerful library for computer vision tasks.
scikit-image: A Python library for image processing and analysis.
Pytesseract: Extract text from CAPTCHA images.
Selenium: Automate browser interactions.
